# Config Parameters

This README explains different parameters used to run scaLR using a config file explaining different subsections.

**NOTE**: The majority of parameters defined below follow name-params declaration i.e. you just need to mention the class name in `name` that has to be defined in the codebase & its parameters under `params` dict.

## Device
**device** {str}: `cuda | cpu`  
default: `cuda`  
Device to run the deep learning models on

## Experiment
**dirpath** {str}: `/path/to/dir`  
default: `.`  
Base directory path for all experiments

**exp_name** {str}: `experiment name`  
default: `scalr_test`  
The name of the experiment is usually based on configurations and user choice.
eg. scalr_ct_fs_5000_6

**exp_run** {int}: `0`  
default: `0`  
The n-th run for `exp_name`

*Notes*:  
The final experiment directory would be: `dirpath/{exp_name}_{exp_run}/`  
This will be considered as the root directory for this experiment run, and all subsequent I/O operations like logging, storing files, configs, and results will be saved inside this folder.


## Data
This section(`data` in config) focuses on data loading using specified datapaths, splitting into train/val/test & preprocessing them using mentioned preprocessing techniques.

**sample_chunksize** {int}: `int | null`  
default: `50000`  
Useful for low resource utilization. This will ensure all data is stored in multiple chunks of almost `sample_chunksize` samples. This does not hamper any logic in algorithms but simply ensures that the entire dataset is never loaded all at once on the RAM.  
`null` value will disregard this optimization.

**train_val_test** {dict}:  
This section splits the data using the mentioned splitting technique mentioned in `splitter_config` & required params like `split_ratio` and `stratify` options. Example below.

    splitter_config:
        name: GroupSplitter
        params:
            split_ratio: [7, 1, 2.5]
            stratify: 'donor_id'

- Here are the supported splitters in the platform.
- `StratifiedSplitter`: It ensures every split contains samples from each class available in the data.
- `GroupSplitter`: Stratification ensures samples have the same value for `stratify` column, can not belong to different sets.
- `StratifiedGroupSplitter`: It is the combination of the above 2 spliters. It will be used for the binary classsification(like as disease classification).


**split_datapaths** {str}:  
If you already have data splits - `train`, `val` & `test` directories then you can mention their parent directory path in `split_datapaths` and remove the above `splitter_config`.


**preprocess** {dict}:  
You can mention the normalization techniques and their required parameters available in the platform or create your custom normalization in the library and use it here. You can mention the list of transformations as well as explained below

    preprocess:
        - name: SampleNorm
          params:
            scaling_factor: 1.0

        - name: StandardScaler
          params: 
            with_mean: True
            with_std: False

- You can opt for uni or multi-transformations. The above example will apply `SampleNorm` normalization first and then `StandardScaler` normalization. 

- Currently, the platform supports `SampleNorm` and `StandardScaler` for normalizations.


**target** {str}: `target`  
Target to perform classification on. Must be present as a column_name in `adata.obs`


## Feature Selection
This section(`feature_selection` in config) focuses on feature subsetting, training on each subset and feature selection at the end.


**scores**: `/path/to/score_matrix`. [Optional]  
If mentioned, the feature subsetting process will be skipped and this matrix will be used to extract top features based on `feature_selector` config.

**feature_subsetsize** {int}: `int | null`  
default: `5000`  
- Chunks of features to subset data for training the model iteratively.

**model** {dict}:  
Mention the name of the model class in `name` & its required parameters under `params` dict. Example below:

    model:
        name: SequentialModel
        params:
            layers: [5000, 6]
            weights_init_zero: True

- The first value MUST correspond to the input features dimension, and the last layer to the number of output classes. eg.  [10000, 1000, 10] will create a model taking input of 10000-d vectors, and create a 2-layered network having output as 10-d vector.

- Currently platform supports `SequentialModel` for model training.

**model_train_config** {dict}:  
Mention the model of training parameters like `trainer`, `dataloader`, `optimizer`, `loss` functions, epoch, etc. Those are required parameters explained below:

    model_train_config:
        trainer: SimpleModelTrainer

        dataloader: 
            name: SimpleDataLoader
            params:
                batch_size: 25000
                padding: 5000
        
        optimizer:
            name: SGD
            params:
                lr: 1.0e-3
                weight_decay: 0.1

        loss:
            name: CrossEntropyLoss
        
        epochs: 1

- Current support/s in the platform for the following model configurations is/are:
    - trainer: `SimpleModelTrainer`
    - dataloader: `SimpleDataLoader|SimpleMetaDataLoader`
    - loss: pytorch supported all inbuilt loss functions. The class name should match exactly with a torch.nn class names.


**scoring_config** {dict}:  
Mention the scorer config example given below

    scoring_config: 
        name: LinearScorer


- Currently, the platform supports `LinearScorer` and `ShapScorer` for scoring the features.


**features_selector** {dict}:  
Mention the feature aggregation strategy and its required parameters explained below

    features_selector:
        name: AbsMean
        params:
            k: 5000

- Currently, the platform supports the following `feature_selectors`:
    - `AbsMean` - abs followed by mean across all class types
    -  `ClasswisePromoters` - top K promoters per class
    -  `ClasswiseAbs` - top K from promoters and inhibitors combined


## Final Training
This section(`final_training` in config) focuses on model training on the data.

        - name: EarlyStopping
            params:
            patience: 3
            min_delta: 1.0e-4
        - name: ModelCheckpoint
            params:
            interval: 5

- Currently, the platform supports `TensorboardLogger`, `EarlyStopping` & `ModelCheckpoint` for callbacks.

## Analysis
This section(`analysis` in config) focuses on generating classification reports, gene analysis like biomarker identification, and further downstream analysis like SHAP, gene recall, DGE, etc.

**model_checkpoint** {str}:  `/path/to/best_model` [Optional]  
Path to load the model from. If your model resides under say `best_model/` directory, then you need to mention the path till `best_model/`. During end-to-end platform runs, it is not required. It is required when you are performing analysis independently after model training.

**dataloader** {dict}:  
The dataloader has to be exactly similar to what was used during the final training of the model. Example in `feature_selection` part.

**gene_analysis** {dict}:  
                name: ShapScorer
This section consists of parameters for Linear and SHAP scorer-based ranked feature information, as seen in `feature_selection` section as well. The `scoring_config` will score the gene for each class type and `feature_selector` will extract the top biomarkers for each class type as per the mentioned strategy. Explained below are the 2 options available for `scoring_config`.

1. Gene analysis using LinearScorer (Default)

        gene_analysis:
            scoring_config:
